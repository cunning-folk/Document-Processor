This is a simple test document to verify the document processing system.

It contains basic text that should be processed correctly by the OpenAI assistant.

The system should be able to:
- Extract this text content
- Send it to OpenAI for formatting
- Return properly formatted markdown

This test helps verify that the core processing pipeline works when file encryption is not interfering with uploads.
